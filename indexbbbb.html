<h1>Information About Websites Development</h1>
<h2>What is Website?</h2>
<pe>A website is a collection of publicly<b><u><i> accessible, interlinked Web pages</i></u></b> that share a single domain name. Websites can be created and maintained by an individual, group, business or organization to serve a variety of purposes.
<br>
<br>Together, all publicly accessible websites constitute the World Wide Web.
<br>         Although it is sometimes called<b><u><i> “web page,”</i></u></b> this definition is wrong, since a website consists of several webpages. A website is also known as a<b><u><i> “web presence”</b></u></i><b><i> or</b></i><b><u><i> simply “site”</b></u></i>.
<h2>How to access Websites?</h2>
<pe>When we type a certain <b><i>URL</b></i> in a browser search bar, the browser requests the page from the Web server and the Web server returns the required web page and its content to the browser. Now, it differs how the server returns the information required in the case of<b><u><i> static</b></u></i><b><i> and </b></i><b><u><i>dynamic websites</b></u></i>. 
<h2>Types Of Websites</h2>
<pe>There are Two main types of websites.
<br><b><u><i>1.Static Website
<br>2.Dynamic Website</i></u></b>
<h4>1.Static Website</h4>
<pe>In Static Websites,Server side languages are use, Web pages are returned by the server which are prebuilt source code files built using simple languages such as<b> HTML, CSS, or JavaScript</b>. <b>There is no processing of content on the server (according to the user) in Static Websites</b>. Web pages are returned by the server with no change therefore, static Websites are fast. There is no interaction with databases. Also, they are less costly as the host does not need to support<b><u><i> server-side processing</i></u></b> with different languages. 
<h4>2.Dynamic Website</h4>
<pe> In Dynamic Websites,User define languages use, Web pages are returned by the server which are processed during runtime means they are not prebuilt web pages but they are built during runtime<b> according to the user’s demand with the help of server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Node.js, ASP.NET and many more supported by the server</b>. So, they are slower than static websites but updates and interaction with databases are possible.  
<h2> Server-side Programming	</h2>


<pe>1) Querying the database<br>
2) Operations over databases<br>
3) Access/Write a file on server<br>
4) Interact with other servers<br>
5) Structure web applications<br>
6) Process user input. For example if user input is a text in search box, run a search algorithm on data stored on server and send the results.<br>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<pe>The Programming languages for server-side programming are <br>
1) PHP<br>
2) C++<br>
3) Java and JSP<br>
4) Python<br>
5) Ruby on Rails<br>
<h2>Client-side Programming</h2>
<pe>It is the program that runs on the client machine (browser) and deals with the user interface/display and any other processing that can happen on client machine like reading/writing cookies.<br>
1) Interact with temporary storage<br>
2) Make interactive web pages<br>
3) Interact with local storage<br>
4) Sending request for data to server<br>
5) Send request to server<br>
6) work as an interface between server and user<br>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pe>1) Javascript<br>
2) VBScript<br>
3) HTML<br>
4) CSS<br>
5) AJAX<br>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<pe><b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.
<br>
<br>Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.
<h3>CSS</h3>
<pe>CSS stand for <b>(Cascading Style Sheets)</b> fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.<br>
<br>
<br>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.
<br>
<br>CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.																					
<h3>Javascript</h3>
<pe>JavaScript is a very powerful<b> client-side scripting</b> language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.
<br>
<br>The language was initially called<b> LiveScript and was later renamed JavaScript</b>. There are many programmers who think that JavaScript and Java are the same. In fact, JavaScript and Java are very much unrelated. Java is a very complex programming language whereas JavaScript is only a scripting language. The syntax of JavaScript is mostly influenced by the programming language C.
<h3>PHP</h3>
<pe>PHP is a <b>server side scripting language</b>. that is used to develop Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web applications. PHP stands for<b> Hypertext Pre-processor</b>, that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages.
<br>
<br>PHP means – <b>Personal Home Page</b>, but it now stands for the recursive backronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
<br>
<br>It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.
<h3>Python</h3>
<pe>Python is a computer programming language often <b>used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis</b>. Python is a general purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems				
<br>
<br>Like most programming languages, Python works in tandem with an interpreter that executes the finalized lines of codes. There are lots of free resources to learn the Python coding language, which, with its basis in English syntax, is considered one of the least fussy and most straightforward coding languages to learn and read.
<h3>Java and JSP</h3>
<pe><b>JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a Java standard technology that enables you to write dynamic, data-driven pages for your Java web applications</b>. JSP is built on top of the Java Servlet specification. The two technologies typically work together, especially in older Java web applications.
